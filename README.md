# Langton's Ant

This web app is an interactive simulator for [Langton Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant), a famous cellular automaton. The ant moves on a grid, turning left or right based on the color of the cell it visits, and changes the cell's color according to customizable rules.

Features:
- Visualize the ant's movement and the evolving grid in real time.
- Add, remove, and customize color/turn rules.
- Step forward and backward, jump to any step, and control simulation speed.
- Zoom and pan the grid for detailed exploration.
- Reset the simulation at any time.
